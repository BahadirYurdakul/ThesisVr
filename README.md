# UnityVR Extendable

This project consists of unity assets to render 360-degrees VR videos and draw assets and textures on screen by external api.

It welcomes user by 360-degrees video selecting room.
Then user can select video room to watch the video and watch the 360-degrees video by preferred vr cardboard such as https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/.

The project supports integration of external api such as face recognition api (https://github.com/emrsmsrli/VRXDFaceRecognition) via unity hooks api (https://github.com/emrsmsrli/VRXDPluginAPI).
External api can draw texture and supported assets to the screen.
For example, face recognition api writes details of every recognized person on the video screen at a time thanks to unity hooks api.
